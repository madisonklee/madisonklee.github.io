			<p>Hello there! My name is Madison Lee. I recently graduated from Columbia University (May 2023) where I studied computer science within the applications track. Currently, I work at IBM as a Data Scientist in the Client Engineering Division.</p>
			<p>Previously, I worked as a Product Manager and Product Designer for a Columbia-built startup called UpFront. For my sophomore and junior year summers, I was a SWE and Technology Sales Intern at IBM. I’ve also worked as a Research Assistant at the Lamont Doherty Earth Observatory, where I co-authored a publication in paleo-biology. Moreover, I volunteered as a Girls Who Code Club teacher throughout my high school and college years. Teaching, tutoring, and mentoring in STEM subjects are some of my favorite hobbies because I understand the importance of nurturing teachers when it comes to “complex” subjects.</p>
			<p>Currently, I am exploring different programming languages and attempting to build some creative side projects. On my non-laptop time, however, I love to read, fall into Wikipedia holes, and work out. Ideally, I'm looking for PM, SWE, and Data Scientist roles.</p>
