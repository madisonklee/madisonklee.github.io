		<!-- Problem Framing -->
		<section class="section">
			<h2>Problem Framing</h2>
			<div class="problem-content">
				<div class="problem-point">
					<h3>The Discovery</h3>
					<p>I got into perfumes about a year and a half ago, but I've never been someone who overconsumes. I found myself constantly smelling perfumes in stores but rarely buying because I didn't want to spend $150 on just any scent. This led me to discover smaller indie brands-some with unique fragrances, some offering dupes of high-end perfumes.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="problem-point">
					<h3>The Market Gap</h3>
					<p>As I dove deeper into the perfume world, I realized there's a vibrant community of enthusiasts and a vast number of small brands that few people have ever heard of. From an AI and tech perspective, I saw an inefficiency: these small brands were going undiscovered, users didn't have a central place to explore and share insights, and the market was fragmented.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="problem-point">
					<h3>The Vision</h3>
					<p>I set out to build the "Hugging Face of perfumes"-a platform where brands can upload their own information and users can easily search for and discover fragrances. Existing databases like Fragrantica and Parfumo didn't give brands control over their listings and often prioritized outdated interfaces over user experience. The problem was clear: small brands lacked visibility, users lacked control, and the market was inefficient.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="problem-point">
					<h3>Constraint</h3>
					<p>I was the only "frag-head" technologist I knew, meaning I had to build this entirely solo.</p>
				</div>

		<!-- Product & Design Thinking -->
		<section class="section">
			<h2>Product & Design Thinking</h2>
			<div class="design-content">
				<div class="design-section">
					<h3>User Research & Insights</h3>
					<p>To build a platform that truly helped fragrance enthusiasts, I spoke with friends and members of the fragrance community. Their needs ranged from simply wanting to know a perfume's notes to wanting a comprehensive, all-in-one platform.</p>
					
					<div class="user-segments">
						<div class="segment">
							<h4>Casual users</h4>
							<p>Most didn't even know fragrance databases existed. The key was to offer them a simple, intuitive experience.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="segment">
							<h4>Enthusiast users</h4>
							<p>Already active on other platforms, they needed reasons to switch-access to small indie brands, direct communication with brands, discovery tools, and a better, ad-free experience.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="segment">
							<h4>Small brands</h4>
							<p>These brands had never had a voice on a democratized platform. The challenge was making the platform simple enough for non-technical users while providing real exposure.</p>
						</div>
						<div class="segment">
							<h4>Large brands</h4>
							<p>This would be the hardest group to engage, so my strategy was to focus on user and small brand traction first before targeting them.</p>

			<div class="execution-content">
				<div class="execution-column">
					<h3>Design</h3>
					<p>I iterated multiple times to achieve a look that was chic, playful, and easy to understand. Every feature had to be intuitive and functional, following the principle that there is beauty when something works and it works intuitively.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="execution-column">
					<h3>Engineering</h3>
					<p>I built the platform using Next.js, connecting front- and back-end seamlessly, and hosted the database on Google Cloud. This setup allowed me to scale while keeping the system maintainable.</p>
