            <div class="problem-content">
                <div class="problem-point">
                    <h3>The Discovery</h3>
                    <p>My mom had a stroke 10 years ago, and I saw firsthand how difficult it was to find apps that addressed her specific needs. Existing stroke recovery apps were limited, full of ads, and often confusing to follow. I realized there was an opportunity to create a better, patient-centered solution—one designed with real users and their caregivers in mind. This project was developed alongside my mom's ongoing feedback.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="problem-point">
                    <h3>The Market Gap</h3>
                    <p>Most existing apps for stroke recovery:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Focus on generic therapy exercises, not tailored to patients with aphasia or apraxia</li>
                        <li>Are filled with ads, overwhelming visuals, and poor UX</li>
                        <li>Lack guided speech-movement examples to help patients practice accurately at home</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="problem-point">
                    <h3>The Vision</h3>
                    <p>I set out to build an intuitive, ad-free app that enables stroke patients to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Practice speech and movement exercises at their own pace</li>
                        <li>Follow guided, step-by-step examples for therapy</li>
                        <li>Feel empowered and supported in their recovery journey</li>

                    <h3>Constraint</h3>
                    <p>I wasn't sure how to create speech-guided movement exercises without recording actual audio/video. (Today, AI tools could easily solve this challenge.)</p>
